Datasets used in paper, please see paper for additional details:
[Dataset 1](http://sara.molbiol.ox.ac.uk/dwaithe/software/data/dataset1.zip) Simulation closely resembles cultures of HL60 cells with their nuclei stained with DAPI, which is a fluorescent DNA binding agent commonly applied in the life sciences for cell counting.

[Dataset 2](http://sara.molbiol.ox.ac.uk/dwaithe/software/data/dataset2.zip) The second dataset  has been designed to closely simulate colon tissue sampled from human patients suffering from adenocarcinoma, a type of cancer.

[Dataset 3](http://sara.molbiol.ox.ac.uk/dwaithe/software/data/dataset3.zip) 3-D confocal micrographs acquired from Drosophila melanogaster fly brains cultured for several days, fixed and then stained with DAPI nuclear dye, which stained the nuclei of the cells within the brain. 

[Dataset 4](http://sara.molbiol.ox.ac.uk/dwaithe/software/data/dataset4.zip) deep 3-D volume imaging of the heart organ from intact Zebrafish embryos.
